Breakbox.as is the one you would want to compile.
I used FlashDevelop and Adobe flex sdk 4.5, they are both free.
Some features (NativeApplication) are only available in Air 
and not in the flash payer, so it is best to setup your project to test in adl.
An application descriptor and an example batch file to package the app are include in the bin.
I also strongly advice not to go under the Air 2.6 namespace.
